#   --- SCRIPT: CALCULATE INTENSITY-WEIGHTED CLUSTER CENTROIDS ---
#
# Description:
# This script loads an aggregated peak list with cluster assignments (from DBSCAN)
# and calculates the intensity-weighted centroid for each cluster. This provides a
# more robust and representative coordinate for each feature, as it is pulled

# towards the highest-intensity peaks. The results are saved and visualized.
